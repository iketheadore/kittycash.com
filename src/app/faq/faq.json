        "question": "How do you play KittyCash?",
        "answer": "To play KittyCash you need to first download our wallet that we conveniently call The Kittery and then obtain a Kitty. You can win one in a contest or participate in our KittyDrop. Once you have the Kitty you will have to take care of it to make sure it\u2019s healthy and does not die. Your Kitty has to be fed at least once every few days. You can also fully customize your Kitty with our wide range of accessories. All the Kitties can breed with each other to create an offspring that you can use to play the game or trade it with other players. After you fed and dressed up your Kitty you\u2019re ready to explore the game. In the future we will launch a series of mini-games where you can compete with other players and win accessories and items. We will be working on a racing game, arcade game and open world game called KittyCash World. KittyCash is playable via our desktop wallet which is compatible with Linxus, macOS and Windows. The KittyCash Alpha is currently live."

We will supply your Kitty with food and all the required items, but you can buy additional items and accessories if you wish to speed up your game progress or get some unique accessories for your Kitty. KittyCash allows you to play the game for free, but specific actions as trading or breeding have a small fee attached."

        "question": "Why are you running the KittyCash Alpha?",
        "answer": "As every other game we need to make sure that our game is properly developed and flawless before we can push out the final release. The Alpha will be used to find the bugs and issues in the game code, but also to attract wider audience as it will be a free-trial of the game for our community. You will be able to experience the basic features of the game such as feeding, customization with accessories, breeding and trading. During the Alpha we will not release any mini-games as we will be focused on finishing the breeding algorithms and the game mechanics. There will be also only one breed available at the beginning of the Alpha, Tabby, and all the offspring will be of this same breed."

        "answer": "All our Kitties have a unique digital DNA. It works pretty much as in the real world.

        "question": "Is KittyCash running on Ethereum blockchain?",
        "answer": "No, the Ethereum blockchain gets congested very easily during busy times, this drives fees and transaction times high. Ethereum blockchain is centralized and is controlled by its founder Vitalik Buterin. KittyCash is part of the Skycoin ecosystem and employs Skycoin\u2019s next generation Fiber blockchain technology."

      {
        "question": "What are the advantages of using Skycoin\u2019s ecosystem?",

Skycoin offers public-private blockchain platform that provides instanteanous and feeless transactions.

      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the world need blockchain games?",
        "answer": "As the Ethereum co-founder rightly observed, centralization sucks. In-game items often hold monetary or sentimental value for players and they should be the rightful owners of these items and game developers should not have the power to take these virtual goods away from the players. Blockchain ensures that players are the only owners of their in-game items and can do with them as they please."
