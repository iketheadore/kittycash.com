        "answer": "To play KittyCash you need to first download our wallet that we conveniently call The Kittery and then obtain a Kitty. You can win one or buy one from our website. Once you have the Kitty you will have to take care of it to make sure it\u2019s healthy and does not die. Your Kitty has to be fed at least once every few days.

All the Kitties can breed with each other to create an offspring that you can use to play the game or trade it with other players. After you fed and dressed up your Kitty you\u2019re ready to explore the game. In the future we will launch a series of mini-games where you can compete with other players and win accessories and items. We\u2019re currently working on racing game, arcade game and open world game called KittyCash World. KittyCash is playable via our desktop wallet compatible with Linxus, macOS and Windows. KittyCash Alpha is currently live and allows players to obtain Kitties for miners, community engagement and other contributions to the project.

You will be able to experience the basic features of the game such as feeding, customization with accessories, breeding and trading. During the Alpha we will not release any mini-games as we will be focused on perfecting the breeding algorithms and the game mechanics. There will be also only one breed available at the beginning of the Alpha, Tabby, and all the offspring will be of this same breed."

        "question": "How does breeding work?",
        "answer": "Our breeding algorithm is fairly complicated and very realistic as it\u2019s developed by using the real-world breeding mechanics. All our Kitties carry a Kitty-DNA chain that will affect the outcome of breeding once their bred. It works exactly as in the real world. Breeding outcome is affected positively and negatively by several factors such as breed of the parents and their ancestors, crossbreeding between two different breeds, inbreeding between Kitties with direct family relation, health points of the parents and by how often the Kitties are used for breeding. If you want to achieve better results of breeding you should make sure that your Kitty is healthy and not in direct family relation to other Kitty."

      {
        "question": "Is KittyCash running on Ethereum blockchain?",
        "answer": "No, the Ethereum blockchain gets congested very easily during busy times, this drives fees and transaction times high. Ethereum blockchain is centralized and is controlled by its founder Vitalik Buterin.

      {
        "question": "What are the advantages of using Skycoin\u2019s ecosystem?",
        "answer": "There are several reasons why we\u2019ve decided to run KittyCash on Skycoin. Skycoin offers public-private blockchain platform that provides instanteanous and feeless transactions. By using Skycoin\u2019s Fiber platform we have access to Obelisk consensus algorithm that works on a free and decentralized Skywire internet."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does the world need blockchain games?",
        "answer": "As the Ethereum co-founder rightly observed, centralization sucks. In-game items often hold monetary or sentimental value for players and they should be the rightful owners of these items and game developers should not have the power to take these virtual goods away from the players. Blockchain ensures that players are the only owners of their in-game items and can do with them as they please."
